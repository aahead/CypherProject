This website:
- Accepts input from the user on a word or phrase, amount of shifting through the alphabet, and shift direction.
- takes this input and either decrypts it, by shifting the letters inputted through the alphabet, or encrypting it by doing the same.
- And then ouputs the result at the bottom of the page after the submit button is pressed.
